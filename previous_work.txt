Privious work - and maybe people to contact for taining data:

Image filters (so no training data) for hold detection - median filter, canny, otsu, convex hull, blob detector. They also tried to classify to color.

Stephans paper on matching (supp has details on the method, stephan has the java code 3D impmenetation):
geometric description matching (in our case can also use color & size and use weights for the different descriptors)
due to perspective might be better to represent the distances normalized
KDtree of the detections
ransac (for perspective transformation) - doubt we can use it due to number of detections per image.
